\## About the source code



Briefly, this is source code initialized from uv. It's not like regular Python; you need to use `winget install` or `pip install uv` to install uv.



\### How to install via winget, which is recommended



Like me, if you don't have Python, you can install uv as follows:

Open cmd and enter



```cmd

winget install Astral.UV

```



Then, enter



```cmd

uv --version

```



to check. If it shows the uv version, it means you've succeeded.



\### Adding libraries



It's very simple, just enter the command



```cmd

uv add <library name>

```



and it will add the package you requested.



For example



```cmd

uv add pygame

```



You will be able to add the library.



\### Running code



It's very simple, you just need to enter the command



```cmd

uv run main.py

```



and the code will be executed.
